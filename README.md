# Password Generator Script

Generate strong and secure passwords with this Python script. Customize your passwords by choosing the length and character types you want. This script creates passwords that include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, ensuring a higher level of security for your online accounts.

## How It Works

1. **Choose Your Preferences:** Specify the desired password length and select the character types to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).

2. **Mix and Match:** The script generates password groups for different character types based on your preferences. Any remaining characters are distributed evenly among these groups.

3. **Random Shuffling:** Characters within each group are shuffled to introduce an element of randomness, enhancing password security.

4. **Password Assembly:** The script assembles characters from each group to create the final password. The characters are arranged in a random order for added protection.

5. **Save Your Password:** Optionally, you can save the generated password to a text file for easy reference.

## Used Libraries

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html): Used for generating random values for shuffling characters.

## Important Notes

- Be cautious with how you store and share your passwords. Never share your passwords with others and avoid storing them in insecure locations.

- Consider the security implications of the systems you use to store the generated passwords. Using a secure password manager is recommended.

## License
